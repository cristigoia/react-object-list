Component used to display an array of object based data in a sortable, filterable, paginated, list based view, powered by React.

Custom components can be passed in if they are designed to handle the same props as the default components. This functionality is available for the DataRenderer, Pagination and ErrorMessage and your component can simply be passed in through the props with one of the above keys.
